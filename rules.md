1. No Bigotry
> Discrimination against community members based on gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, neurotype, or other similar characteristics is prohibited.

2. No Harassment/Bullying
> Harassment is any repetitive unwanted behavior that makes a reasonable person feel uncomfortable, humiliated, or mentally distressed.

3. New members **must** be 21+

4. You must be a resident in or around the Portland, OR Metro Area, a regular visitor to the community, or plan to move to the area
> Certain exceptions may be made for long-standing legacy members who have moved away, but in general if you are not in or around Portland, this is not the server for you. This is a server built around forging and maintaining real-life friendships.

5. Ask consent before sharing other people's stuff
> Do not post pictures of people, or any identifying information that people are not already open about on this server (e.g. their workplace or pictures of their home) without asking first. You must ask that user for permission every time, not just once.

6. This server is strictly SFW
> Don't post anything lewd, upsetting, or overly obscene (e.g. gore). If asked to spoiler/delete, please do so. This server is for adults, so some casual allusions to or jokes about adult-only topics are permitted. The general guideline here is "if you're not sure, don't post it".

7. No spam or advertising
> If you have a project or similar idea you want to plug, #üé´-open-a-ticket to ask for permission first. Reasonable cases by established members will likely be granted (e.g. linking your Etsy page because you made a new craft).
> 
> No requests for donations or similar fundraising will be permitted.

8. **This is not a dating server**
> This server is for making friends. Romantic or sexual relationships may naturally emerge out of friendships, and are allowed. However, participation in this server or IRL events that appears to be primarily for the purpose of finding romantic or sexual partners is prohibited. Friendly, occasional flirting is allowed, consensually; if things get too heavy take it to DMs.

9. No "vagueposting" or "subtweeting" other members
> We respect that sometimes people have interpersonal conflicts and want to vent to their friends or get outside perspectives. However, posting about situations or problems with other members with the names erased makes it difficult to maintain a space that feels comfortable for everyone. If we suspect or know someone is vagueposting about other members, we reserve the right to contact involved parties to check and make sure everybody feels safe and cared for.
> 
> Action generally will not be taken in the case of posts where all involved parties are okay with them being anonymous, but you may still be asked to stop if a pattern of doing so is beginning to make other server members uncomfortable.

10.  All leadership decisions are final
> If a mod tells you to do something regarding the server rules or community safety, do so. If you have a strong objection, do not argue in chat, instead #üé´-open-a-ticket.

11.  No heated political discussion
> This server is not ‚Äúapolitical‚Äù, but for the sake of maintaining a friendly space, we do not allow heated discussion about controversial or political topics, particularly with regards to electoral politics, geopolitics, or current events.
