1. Be courteous about expressing interest in events
> If you mark "interested" that means "yes", not "maybe". We of course understand things come up, but in general flaking on events is heavily discouraged. People can get discouraged when events have much lower turnout than expected. 
> 
> This is especially true if you're the organizer, please do not cancel events people were looking forward to at the last minute even if you can't attend.
>
> If you must cancel attendance or a whole event, please communicate with your attendees/the organizer where possible.
> 
> For events that need accurate headcounts (e.g. restaurant reservations), repeated flaking may warrant (minor) action. We also recommend not using the Discord event system for such events, or similar limited capacity events, but instead organizing with people directly (whether privately or in a thread in the #event-planning forum).

2. Have an existing relationship when DMing someone for the first time
> Most of the potential problems with unsolicited DMs are covered by the actual rules (no spam, not a dating server, etc). In general, we feel that sending a friend request or message request that the recipient actively accepts should be sufficient to establish consent with regard to DMs. However, we *heavily* suggest that you have at least some rapport built from in-server or in-person interaction with somebody before sending a request. Please report creepy or otherwise unwelcome DMs or friend requests via #ðŸŽ«-open-a-ticket . On the same note, please take somebody rejecting your friend or message request gracefully. Brand new members are *heavily* encouraged to spend a few days interacting before initiating DMs with anyone.
> 
> For official server business, it is okay to DM a moderator without a prior relationship.

3. Be responsible about interpersonal matters that may affect other members
> Ultimately this server is a real-life friend group. Sufficiently large interpersonal issues between members can spill over and cause confusion, hurt, or frustration. We would like to foster reconciliation rather than division among our community, and not leave anybody hurt and confused in the dark.
> 
> We recommend resolving matters privately where possible. However, If matters get advanced enough to start making members uncomfortable or reluctant to participate in the community, we ask that matters be resolved in a manner that is honest, open, communicative, and responsible. 
> 
> When absolutely needed, if a group of people becomes particularly acrimonious or volatile with no clear "offending party", leadership may elect to enforce soft-bans on interaction between specific members or bar some members from attending other members' events as a last resort until the matter is properly resolved. Violating or circumventing said measures will be considered harassment.

4.  Bring IRL issues to server leadership 
> If somebody, including server leaders, are harming you or making you feel unsafe, please #ðŸŽ«-open-a-ticket. If you are being harmed by a moderator, notify a trusted member of the moderation team via DM.
